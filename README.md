# Abstract

## Workshop


Use the unique benefits of Internet of Things (IoT) to build a smart city solution to help improve traffic and public transportation in New York City. Use a combination of the power of the cloud, along with IoT Edge devices to provide anomaly detection of city buses (engine anomalies and aggressive driving detection), location broadcasting to update bus route status, and to send traffic information to help inform the timing of traffic lights. Traffic lights will also receive new IoT devices that can help detect maintenance and performance issues, such as voltage irregularities. Easily view all of this information through a centralized reporting dashboard provided by Azure Time Series Insights. Use the IoT Remote Monitoring starter solution to manage and simulate IoT devices, set alerts, and view data on a map.

Learning Objectives:

-   Use IoT Hub to manage IoT devices

-   Configure and run the IoT Remote Monitoring starter solution to provision, manage, and simulate telemetry for IoT devices via IoT Hub SDKs, configure alerts on device telemetry, send actions to devices, and view devices on a map

-   Use Azure IoT Edge to collect vehicle telemetry data, detect anomalies with the help of a local Azure Stream Analytics module, and send the summarized data to Azure IoT Hub as needed

-   Create a custom endpoint in IoT Hub to route critical alerts to a Service Bus Queue

-   Create an Azure function that extracts critical alerts from the Service Bus Queue and stores them in Cosmos DB

-   Use Azure Time Series Insights to store, visualize, and query the large amounts of time series data generated by various IoT devices, as well as conduct root-cause analysis and anomaly detection
