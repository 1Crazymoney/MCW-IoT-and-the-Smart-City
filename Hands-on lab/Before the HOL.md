## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration:** 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment you will use for the rest of the exercises.

### Task 1: Perform a deployment of the LABVM

In this task you will perform a deployment of a the VM that will be used during this lab.

1.  Open a new private or incognito tab in your web browser, and then connect to <https://github.com/solliancenet/LABVM>.

2.  Scroll down and locate the **IoT for Business** selection and click the **Deploy to Azure** button.

    ![The IoT for Business LABVM repo on GitHub.com is shown. The Deploy to Azure button has been selected.](images/Setup/image3.png 'IoT for business LABVM')

3.  You will need to then authenticate with Azure.

    ![Use the sign in form to authenticate with your Azure account.](images/Setup/image4.png 'Authentication dialog')

4.  On the Custom Deployment page enter IoTBusiness as the Resource group and select a Location close to you.

    ![Enter IoTBusiness as the Resource Group, and a Location close to you on the Custom Deployment page.](images/Setup/image5.png 'Custom deployment dialog')

5.  Next, update the LABVM DNS Name providing a globally unique name 3-24 alpha-numeric characters which are lowercase. Check the I agree to the terms and conditions stated above and then click Purchase.

- Validate connectivity to your Azure subscription. Launch Visual Studio, open **Server Explorer** from the View menu, and ensure that you can connect to your Azure subscription.

You should follow all steps provided _before_ performing the Hands-on lab.

### Task 3: Download starter solution

There are several artifacts that will be used in this hands-on lab. All of these files are located on GitHub and can be downloaded as follows:

1. From your LABVM, download the starter project by downloading a .zip copy of the IoT for Business GitHub repo.
