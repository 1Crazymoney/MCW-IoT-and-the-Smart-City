## Before the hands-on lab

**Duration:** 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment you will use for the rest of the exercises.

### Task 1: Perform a deployment of the LABVM

In this task you will perform a deployment of a the VM that will be used during this lab.

1.  Open a new private or incognito tab in your web browser, and then connect to <https://github.com/solliancenet/LABVM>

2.  Scroll down and locate the **IoT for Business** selection and click the **Deploy to Azure** button

    ![The IoT for Business LABVM repo on GitHub.com is shown. The Deploy to Azure button has been selected.](images/Setup/image3.png "IoT for business LABVM")

3.  You will need to then authenticate with Azure

    ![Use the sign in form to authenticate with your Azure account.](images/Setup/image4.png "Authentication dialog")

4.  On the Custom Deployment page enter IoTBusiness as the Resource group and select a Location close to you

    ![Enter IoTBusiness as the Resource Group, and a Location close to you on the Custom Deployment page.](images/Setup/image5.png "Custom deployment dialog")

5.  Next, update the LABVM DNS Name providing a globally unique name 3-24 alpha-numeric characters which are lowercase. Check the I agree to the terms and conditions stated above and then click Purchase.

    ![Update the LABVM DNS Name with a globally unique name consisting of 3-24 alpha-numeric lowercase characters. Check the I agree to the terms and conditions checkbox, then click Purchase.](images/Setup/image6.png "LAVM DNS Name dialot")

>Note: The VM will take about 45 minutes to provision. You will need to wait for this deployment to complete prior to continuing.

6.  Once the Deployment completes, you can locate your VM in the **IotBusiness** Resource group. Open the **LABVM** and click **Connect**

    ![Click the Connect link within the LABVM virtual machine Overview blade.](images/Setup/image7.png "LABVM connect button")

7.  Login to the LABVM using the following credentials:

    a.  Username: demouser

    b.  Password: Password.1!!

        ![Enter demouser as the username, and Password.1!! as the password.](images/Setup/image8.png "Login credential fields")

8.  A Remote Desktop Warning will appear. Click **Don't ask me again for connections to this computer** and they click **Yes**.

    ![Check the Don\'t ask me again for connections to this computer, then click Yes on the Remote Desktop Connection Warning dialog.](images/Setup/image9.png "Remote Desktop Connection warbubg dialog box")

9.  You will receive a message about allowing your PC to be discoverable. Click **No**

    ![Select No when asked whether you want to allow your PC to be discoverable by other PCs and devices on this network.](images/Setup/image10.png "Network pop-up")

10. Once connected double click the Docker Icon to start the application. This will take a couple of minutes to start. You can click in the taskbar to ensure that is reads "Docker is Starting"

    ![Docker for Windows icon.](images/Setup/image11.png "Docker for Windows icon") ![Double-click the Docker Icon within the Windows taskbar to ensure Docker has started.](images/Setup/image12.png "Windows taskbar docker icon")

11. When Docker for Windows is up and running you will receive the following message

    ![When Docker is open and displayed, it should say \"Docker is now up and running!\".](images/Setup/image13.png "Docker Welcome page")

### Task 2: Validate connectivity to Azure

-   From within the virtual machine, launch **Visual Studio** and validate that you can log in with your Microsoft Account when prompted

-   Validate connectivity to your Azure subscription. Launch Visual Studio, open **Server Explorer** from the View menu, and ensure that you can connect to your Azure subscription.

### Task 3: Download and explore the solution files

-   Create a new folder on your C: drive named IoTLab

-   Download the sample application from here: <http://bit.ly/2E6LTT9> and extract to the IoTLab folder. You will need to copy and paste the URL into your browser, as Ctrl+Click does not honor casing in the URL.

> Note: The link above is case sensitive.


The solution is comprised of the following:

|    |            |
|----------|:-------------:|
|  **File / folder name**  | **Description** |
|  azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet |A version of the [Azure IoT Remote Monitoring solution](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-pcs-remote-monitoring-dotnet), which can also be found on Azure IoT Suite. In our lab, this serves as the custom web front-end for viewing simulated IoT device telemetry, setting alert rules, and sending cloud-to-device commands. This is also used for creating new device simulations.  |
|  ReadEngineAlerts      |  tarter project for a custom C\# IoT Edge module that generates vehicle telemetry |
|  VehicleTelemetrySimulator   | Starter project for a custom C\# IoT Edge module that generates vehicle telemetry  |
|  sample-vehicle-telemetry.json   |  Contains 5,000 vehicle telemetry messages, used for testing the IoT Edge Stream Analytics module |

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
